The following work will handle the restructuring of an agronomic data management application. These data, which currently come from various sources, are going to be processed in a new architecture that will enable continuous integration and deployment techniques. In its design, we go through the successive stages of infrastructure, design of a relational model, use of a pipeline for data loading and, finally, obtaining a mineable view on which Artificial Intelligence models will be executed. This view will make it possible to predict, with a regression model, the amount of kilograms of crop that is expected to be harvested in a plot on a given date.
